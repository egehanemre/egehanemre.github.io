#### Description: 

My Project is a personal portfolio website with index.html app.jg and styles/styles.css, i used fontawesome and googlefonts for my texts, i have the references on the head of my html code.

On my header, i have an avatar icon on the top with name on top, also 3 little clickable icons that'll navigate you to my social media accounts.

Under that i have a div including 4 buttons labeled as PROJECTS,SKILLS,EDUCATION and WORK. 
Each on of the buttons have a hidden section inside them with additional content, I've handled the hidden sections with JavaScript.

Under that are my sections with CSS designs.

The way i handled the hidden sections is by firstly removing the scroll event on the navigated section, then making the block invisible until the responsive button has an active button class.
